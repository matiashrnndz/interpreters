Imperative programs describe computing as a series of statements that are executed according to explicit flow control,
and modify memory, made up of variables.                                                                            

Variables contain data, can be modified, and represent the state of the program. The instruction that allows you to modify the value of a variable in memory is the allocation,
and there are functions that allow you to combine statements to define different control flows (sequence, conditional, repetition).

The goal of this work is to define a simple imperative language embedded in Haskell to write and run programs with integer expressions.
